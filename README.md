# College-IBM
We developed an individual based modeling approach (IBM) and Mathematica tools to simulate and study the spread of Covid-like pathogens in college communities. Our approach highlights the importance of social mixing. We account for specific interactions on college campuses (classes, dorms, random social mixing). The college model accommodates multiple inputs: disease specific (biological) and environmental/behavioral factors. It allows us to study their contribution to outbreak patterns, and to explore a range of control/intervention strategies. It could thus provide a useful tool for college administrators to set up and assess the outcomes and efficiency of such interventions.

Creation of synthetic college communities for simulations is handled in Synthetic college.nb.

Model simulation is handled (with a synthetic college or real student data) in College Codes.nb.
